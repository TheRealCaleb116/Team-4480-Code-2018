## Code Standards ##

For example you (Caleb) may prefer,
1. All variable names should be formatted as some_var
2. All class names should start with capital
3. All function names should be camelCase

When possible, use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) practices. Basically, if someone can be broken into a class (like a shooter, intake, etc), you should do it.

All Classes and Functions should have a comment explaining what they are.

keep adding stuff that you (caleb) want
