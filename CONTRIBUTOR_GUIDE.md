# Contributor Guide #

## Getting Started ##
On your local machine, clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/cboy116/Team-4480-Code-2018.git`

Now, you need to create a branch for your code changes. To do this,
run `git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`

Do a test push by making a change to a file, doing `git add .`, `git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"`, and then `git push`.

You may get an error message saying it doesn't know where to push. To solve this run `git push --set-upstream origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`

If the push was successful, go onto the GitHub page and see if your branch shows up!

## The Development Process ##

In the real world (of which we hope to mirror), the process goes...

1. Create new branch
2. Write meaningful code
3. Create a Pull Request (PR)
4. Peer Developer reviews changes
5. If the developer likes the change, the developer approves the Pull Request
6. Now the code is in the master branch and is 'production ready'

Please follow this process. If you have any questions on the process (errors with Github, don't understand, etc.), please just ask Caleb or Josh
